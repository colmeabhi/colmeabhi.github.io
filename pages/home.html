                    I believe the best engineering is quiet &mdash; infrastructure that just works,
                    systems that let people focus on what actually matters. That's the kind of work I care about.
                </p>

                    I spent three years at <a onclick="navigate('work')">Quantiphi</a> building cloud platforms
                    and data pipelines on AWS, learning that the most impactful code is often the code
                    nobody notices. Now I'm at San Jos&eacute; State pursuing my
                    <a onclick="navigate('education')">MS in Computer Science</a>, exploring where that foundation
                    can take me next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not deep in Terraform configs or Kubernetes manifests, I'm probably
                    at a hackathon, at a meetup somewhere in the Bay, or just trying to ask better
                    questions than I did yesterday.
